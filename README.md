<p>An unofficial expansion for the Middle-earth mod, bringing the most ambitious creatures and mechanics from Tolkien's lore into Minecraft.</p>

> - <b>New Entities</b><br>
    <i>• Mûmakil: Massive Siege Beasts you can ride with Howdahs you can walk on.<br>
    • Fell Beasts: Terrifying aerial mounts for the Nazgûl.<br>
    • Haradrim: Fierce warriors from the South.</i>

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Disclaimer:** This addon is still in development and may contain bugs, the artstyle is also not yet defined as I'm a terrible artist, we're currently looking for volunteers or commissions to help with art and development. Your contributions are greatly appreciated!

### 🚧 Future Roadmap: Coming Soon
We are actively developing the next phase of Middle-earth Extras. Here is what is coming in future updates:

<b>Lore Structures & Dungeons</b><br>
We have a custom static placement system that allows you to place lore structures anywhere in the world, with this system we are designing massive, procedurally generated dungeons to challenge your survival skills:  
- Mines of Moria: A sprawling city of rooms and corridors that connect the east and west gates.  
- Erebor (The Lonely Mountain): A possible bossfight against a giant dragon.  
- Barad-dûr: A boss-rush up the Dark Tower, fighting the Mouth of Sauron and the Nâzgul on your way to the top.  

<b>Artifacts & Tools</b><br>
- Palantír: Link seeing stones to spy on distant locations (compatible with Voicechat).  
- The Red Book of Westmarch: A physical journal system that will automatically record your kills, discoveries, and quests.

<b>Dynamic Music</b><br>
A dynamic music system that reacts to biomes and combat intensity (e.g., Drums of War in Mordor).  

<b>Expanded Bestiary</b><br>
Future updates will introduce Ents, the Watcher in the Water, Great Beasts, Black Númenóreans, and siege weapons like Grond and Dwarven Ballistae.
