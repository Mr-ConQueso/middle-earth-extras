<h2>Welcome to the <img src="./.idea/icon.png" width="18"> Middle Earth: Legends <img src="./.idea/icon.png" width="18"> Addon.</h2>
<p>An unofficial expansion for the Middle-earth mod, bringing the most ambitious creatures and mechanics from Tolkien's lore into Minecraft.</p>
<p>We aim to add the missing Titans, complex entity interactions, and immersive mechanics to complete the experience.</p>

## Current state of the mod

This addon is currently in **Alpha** for **Fabric 1.21.1**. It relies on the [Middle Earth Mod](https://github.com/Jukoz/middle-earth) to function.

We are currently focusing on implementing complex "Titan" entities and lore-accurate AI behaviors that extend beyond standard Minecraft mechanics.

## Planned & Implemented Features

> * <b>The Titans (Multi-Part Entities)</b>
>
>
>
>
> <i>Massive entities with complex collision logic. Including the <b>Mûmakil</b> with functional siege towers that players and NPCs can ride freely, and <b>Dragons</b> with hoarding AI.</i>
> * <b>Skin-Changers</b>
>
>
>
>
> <i><b>Beornings</b> that utilize a custom "Rage" state machine to transform between Human and Bear forms, preserving health percentage and inventory during the swap.</i>
> * <b>The Unseen World</b>
>
>
>
>
> <i>A <b>Wraith World</b> mechanic utilizing custom post-processing shaders to alter vision, audio, and entity visibility when wearing Rings of Power.</i>
> * <b>Forces of Nature</b>
>
>
>
>
> <i><b>Ents</b> and <b>Huorns</b> with dormancy mechanics—camouflaging as block trees until threatened or provoked by loggers.</i>
> * <b>Advanced Combat AI</b>
>
>
>
>
> <i>New "Siege" AI for Haradrim Archers, ensuring they strafe and fight from atop moving beasts without losing footing or pathfinding off the edge.</i>
> * <b>Expanded Roster</b>
>
>
>
>
> <i>Including <b>Olog-hai</b> (Sun-resistant trolls), <b>Great Eagles</b>, <b>Shelob</b>, and <b>Balrogs</b> with dynamic physics-based whip attacks.</i>
>
